    <p>My name is Kelly Eames. Welcome to my site where you can view the projects I'm working on in my WEB120 class. I'm new to the world of web design but excited to learn all that I can in order to develop myself as a web designer.</p>
    
    <p>I was born in Seattle, WA and grew up with two older sisters who still live in the area today. I initially started a career in Chemical Depencency Counseling until I decided it was time for a change in the past year. I decided to take a chance and branch out to something entirely foreign to me and enrolled in school for programming and web design.</p>

    <p>In my spare time I enjoy cooking, spending time with my two furry canine friends as well as friends and family as much as possible.</p>
